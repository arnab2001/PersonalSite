## Overview

SolGuide is a real-time collaborative platform where developers can post coding questions and receive instant answers from the community. Built for the Dev.to Appwrite Hackathon in the Web2 Wizards category.

## Key Features

- **Appwrite Authentication**: Secure login and signup powered by Appwrite SDK
- **User Dashboard**: View username, email, and contribution statistics
- **Real-time Q&A**: Ask and answer coding questions in real-time
- **Code Screenshot Support**: Upload code screenshots along with questions
- **Contribution Tracking**: Track your contributions to the community
- **Active Community**: Build an engaged developer community solving problems together

## Technical Implementation

Built with React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, utilizing Appwrite as the Backend-as-a-Service platform. Appwrite SDK handles authentication, database operations, and real-time subscriptions for instant updates when new answers are posted.

## How It Works

1. Users sign up or log in through Appwrite authentication
2. Dashboard displays user profile and contribution count
3. In the Contribution section, users can view questions posted by authors
4. Developers can answer questions in real-time
5. Users can also become authors and post their coding doubts
6. Code screenshots can be attached to questions for better context
7. All interactions are tracked and reflected in user contributions
